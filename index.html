						Tyrol’s version of Siberia is a place where farmers and bears eat from the same bowl and children ride on the
						backs
						of wolves, wrote Innsbrucker Handelsblatt of the 9-home Alpine village of Sulden back in 1802.<br><br>
						Located at the foot of the Austro-Hungarian Empire’s highest peak - the 3,900 metre Ortler - Sulden sits 1,906
						meters above sea level and was probably one of the most isolated villages of the Alps until 1825 when the
						Stelvio
						Pass was built. This paved pass is of the world’s most beautiful mountain roads, doubling as a stretch of the
						Giro
						d’Italia cycling race each summer.

				those wanting to lose and seclude themselves. This is where Winston Churchill came to rest between the two world
				wars, where composer Richard Strauss visited, and where German chancellor Angela Merkel has returned more than
				once. But, tellingly, Sulden is the birthplace of Reinhold Messner - one of the giants of modern mountaineering,

				So, starting from Sulden, we too went on a wilderness discovery adventure, heading toward the peak of Ortler, in
